# Discussion around Government blockchain, ATO and climate change

There are 200 AI people in the government

It is important to have knowledge and talent but, leading in gov isn't the same as leading in industry

USGS MapCorps is a great citizen science project

Australians (citizens) have been putting climate data on chain for at least 5 years

For those interested in using blockchain for environmental purposes:  https://hackernoon.com/artisanal-power-how-to-avert-a-threatened-mass-casualty-event

We have a verbal commitment to pilot this, commercially, in the UK.  Hope to ink it next month....

NASA's Project Planet Earth is a comprehensive initiative focused on studying Earth's systems and processes to enhance our understanding of the planet's environment and climate. Here are some key aspects of this project:

Leveraging double spend protections as auth tokens, anybody ATO'd an event bus? should be very similar

A blockchain or DLT is interesting, especially a public one because only parts of it are under "control". Change will be very hard here, because it is more profitable (today) to duplicate data and force the industry and regulators to operation in a data fog rather than single source of truth authoritative data on chain

An alternative take is to pitch a solution using blockchain but doesn't make a deal of it, but just uses it as the best tool for the (security, distribution) job

**Federal Government Agencies Interested in SustainaCities' Work**

1. U.S. Department of Energy (DOE): 
   - Focus: The DOE is heavily invested in promoting energy efficiency, renewable energy technologies, and sustainable urban development. Its initiatives include funding for innovative technologies aimed at reducing energy consumption in buildings.
   - Relevant Programs: The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) and the Better Buildings Initiative.

2.	Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):
	•	Focus: The EPA is involved in improving environmental quality, climate resilience, and sustainable practices. Its Climate Change Division focuses on resilience and adaptation strategies.
	•	Relevant Programs: Climate Adaptation and Resilience Program, Green Infrastructure Program.

3.	National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA):
	•	Focus: NOAA deals with climate monitoring and resilience, particularly in coastal areas. 

4.	U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT):
	•	Focus: The DOT is interested in sustainable transportation solutions and logistics optimization, especially in light of climate change impacts on infrastructure and mobility.
	•	Relevant Programs: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Program.
	
5.	U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA):
	•	Focus: The USDA is involved in land use and natural resource management, particularly regarding carbon sequestration

Are any systems naturally using hashes, off-chain, as part of its security posture?
eg: bitcoin transactions can provide value even being off chain
